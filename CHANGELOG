## [0.0.9] - 2024-01-01
### Changed
- Added a ".js" file, where you list all JS dependencies (using keys relative to the ".js" directory):
	For example:
	=== contact/.js ===
	script.js
	../js/
	======
	This would include all scripts that appear at these urls:
	"/contact/script.js" and
	"/js/*.js"
- Note that the "js/" directory is NOW IGNORED
- Note that directory keys must end in a slash, to show that they are a directory

## [0.0.1] - 2023-06-11
